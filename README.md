Counter to simulate messages receieved from i.e. mq

Grafana and Prometheus docker images running on minikube scraping the underlying infrastructure as well as pods deployed to kube.

## prerequisites
- [Install minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
- [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [Install helm](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm)

## Bootstrap

Run `sudo .init.sh`

One command completes there should be a minikube installed. To view dashboard run : `minikube dashboard`
Open a browser to `grafana.kube.com` to verify that the ingress config is correct. You should see a login screen. Use admin/admin to log in.
Sudo is needed to add the hostnames, the minikube IP changes with virtualbox driver (at least on mac) (https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/951)

##  Prometheus
Accessible on `prometheus.kube.com`
Exposes metrics to

## Setup grafana
Log in to grafana on `http://grafana.kube.com`
